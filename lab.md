     We are a team of cognitive and computational neuroscientists at the University of Rochester whose mission is to explore how how people construct, remember, and communicate stories and events.
     <br/><br/>
     We study stories in their natural habitat, the human experience, usually through behavioral assays and non-invasive recordings of brain activity as our participants watch captivating movies and describe their exciting adventures in the world beyond the lab.
